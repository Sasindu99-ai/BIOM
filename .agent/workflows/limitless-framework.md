description: Frontend framework for dashboard
---

folder path is at root @Directory:limitless

- All the html files is at ./limitless/demo/html/layout_1/full/
- This is only a template for dashboard and this is not a part of the project, therefore we cannot link any file in this limitless folder to the project
- Requaired files are added to static/ css or js or fonts or icons and can be added the headers using the @file:Files.py
- Dashboard should have the look of limitless components and professionalism and detailed UIs that this dashboard requires
- Use django-cotton components when need for simplicity
- All the UI should work with both light and dark theme as is it in limitless, and there's a style tag to handle eveything in the header.html
- Remember: this is only for dashboard usage in admins app
